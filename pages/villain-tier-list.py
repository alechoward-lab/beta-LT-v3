Welcome to the Living Marvel Champions Tier List!

This project is built by **Daring Lime** to help players analyze and rank heroes
based on a customizable scoring system. On this page, you can learn more about how
scores are computed, how to contribute, or contact me via Discord or YouTube.

If you have feedback or ideas for improvements, feel free to reach out!

### Calculation Method
Each hero is given scores in categories like:
- **Economy**
- **Tempo**
- **Villain Damage**
- *(etc.)*

Your chosen weightings are applied to these categories to compute a final score.

villain_strategies = {
    "Rhino": "Look out for his charge attacks. In solo be careful about going to alter-ego. Always keep track of how many advances are in the discard pile. In expert mode, make sure to finish his side scheme as soon as possible to get rid of the hazard icon.",
    "Klaw": "Klaw adds a lot of pressure early. Minion control, tempo, and threat removal are key to defeating him. Klaw has 2 triple boost cards in his kit. It can be deadly if he gets both of them for the same activation. Keep track of where those cards are.",
    "Ultron": "Ultron floods the board with drones. Make sure you can take them out. If your hero is bad at defeating multiple minions, add Hawkeye to your deck. If your hero deals with minions easily, still consider adding Hawkeye. Try to keep him on stage 1 of his main scheme. Building up your board while controlling minions is key to winning.",
    "Risky Business": "This is a bizarre scenario. Don't flip Norman unless you can deal a big chunk of damage. Building your upgrades and supports while he is Norman Osborn is key to winning.",
    "Mutagen Formula": "There will be a lot of pressure early due to the encounter cards. His encounter deck isn't that scary, but he can flood the board with mid-health minions. Stay in control of the minions, build your board, and try to one-shot him on stage 3 if you can to avoid dealing with all the encounter cards.",
    "Wrecking Crew": "Prioritize taking out one villain at a time. Make heavy use of alter-ego since there is little pressure due to threat.",
    "Crossbones": "Crossbones has a lot of damage, but a generous main scheme. Playing heroes with good survivability will be helpful. His scariest card is Full Auto. Keep track of both copies, and make sure to keep your health high to avoid random losses.",
    "Absorbing Man": "Absorbing Man unfortunately just doesn't do much. The Super Absorbing Power side scheme can give him a boost in power, so prioritize finishing that scheme when it's out. Absorbing Man is a good opportunity to try some of the heroes that are lower on the tier list.",
    "Taskmaster": "Taskmaster does a bit of everything, but nothing is that scary. Don't expect an easy game though! Rescuing the allies that have been Captured By Hydra will help a lot because they're very powerful!",
    "Zola": "Zola brings in a lot of tough minions and having Retaliate 1 is difficult to deal with. He doesn't have high health though. Take every opportunity you get to do big chunks of damage to him. Overkill ignores retaliate damage. Relentless Assault is a great card to add because it solves two problems at once (Minions and Retaliate). Do not underestimate Zola. The game can go bad in an instant!",
    "Red Skull": "Red Skull's ability to bring a side scheme into play every turn and increase his attack is very powerful. It's a lot to deal with. You can't let them pile up. Make sure to bring a Justice player to the table to help keep those schemes in line. Be prepared to deal with The Sleeper. You need to have a source of damage at the ready when The Sleeper comes into play.",
    "Kang": "Kang will throw many different challenges at the players. Particularly on stage 2 when he splits everyone up, you don't know what challenges you will face. Having a reliable hero that is self-sufficient is key to surviving the second stage.",
    "Drang": "Drang adds a lot of threat to the board. The main scheme goes up by 2 per player each turn, and there are a lot of side schemes. In solo the action to exhaust the Milano to remove 3 threat from the schemes is powerful and will help a lot, but at 2–4 players you need more removal. In multiplayer I suggest at least one hero brings a powerful Justice deck.",
    "Collector 1": "The Collection fills up very quickly, especially when you realize that the Collector collects his own cards! I recommend a high-tempo strategy against him. You don't want to stick around building your board against him because it will give him more chances to steal your cards. Allies aren't as good against him because they go into the collection if they block for you. This makes survivability more difficult to solve. Use event-heavy decks because events don't go into the collection and defeat him as quick as possible.",
    "Collector 2": "This scenario is all about removing threat from the main scheme. You can do that either by reducing the Collector's HP to 0 or by thwarting normally. As long as you have a decent deck and make thoughtful decisions, you should be able to win. Be careful about completing the main scheme too quickly. The starting threat is high enough that you can lose to 1 advance. Make sure that you can thwart a little bit after completing each main scheme to help protect against bad luck in the encounter deck.",
    "Nebula": "This scenario is very swingy. Nebula is prone to surge trains. In solo, some games will be easy, and some will be difficult. In 2–4 player count expect to see multiple surge trains. The evasion counters on the main scheme can get out of control quickly. Keep those low at all costs and try to defeat her as soon as possible. The longer you stick around in this scenario the more likely it is that you'll run into a crazy string of encounter cards that will defeat you.",
    "Ronan": "Ronan is the premier final boss of the game. He starts stalwart with high base ATK and will frequently hit for 8–10 damage. To make matters worse, his main scheme goes up by 2 per player each round and has a low threshold. In solo, flipping to alter-ego essentially guarantees you'll lose the main scheme. To make matters worse, Fanaticism is possibly the worst encounter card in the whole game. It gives his next attacks piercing and overkill, and for some reason it also surges. Avoiding this card through either luck or encounter deck manipulation is key to winning. Sunfire is a great ally to take because you can get rid of the Universal weapon without needing to shuffle it into the encounter deck and dealing yourself an encounter card. Fight broken with broken. Go all out to find as many gamebreaking combos as you can when you face Ronan. You'll need them.",
    "Ebony Maw": "Ebony Maw removes a counter from the spell environments \"When\" he activates against you. That means if the last counter is removed, it actually goes off before the activation finishes. That can be rough because sometimes your allies may be defeated before they can block. The easiest way to defeat him is by status locking him to avoid removing counters from the spell environments. Sometimes Ebony Maw will do a crazy surge train and take you out in one turn, so be on guard for that. Most of the time he will be a decent challenge, but a manageable one.",
    "Tower Defense": "This scenario is generally low on pressure because the tower can take so much damage before the players lose. Use the main schemes to your advantage. If you have a lot of health on the tower remaining, it’s okay to let Proxima’s main scheme finish if you are low on threat removal. If you need to protect the tower, it’s okay to let Corvus’s main scheme finish; getting one encounter card isn’t that bad. Sometimes the villains can team up for a big attack, so it’s best to try and always have at least 1 ally available to block as a backup. Be thoughtful, and you should be able to win.",
    "Thanos": "Thanos is a difficult villain, but also an easy villain. It seems like you’re under a lot of pressure at the beginning, but you aren’t actually. Don’t worry about attacking him. The best strategy is to thwart the main scheme and defeat minions while you build up your board. Don’t worry about damaging Thanos until the second deck-pass after you’ve completed your setup and have things under control. Most of the difficulty comes from the gauntlet. As a result, his encounter cards on their own are actually very weak. The only scary card he has is Avatar of Death. Keep track of both copies of that card. When they are in the discard pile, the scariest cards he has are the standard set. Build your board, play around the stones, and win after a long battle.",
    "Hela": "Similar to Thanos, you want to play it slow against Hela. She doesn’t add much pressure at the beginning of the game, especially in multiplayer. That’s because having one acceleration icon on a thick main scheme doesn’t do much. Amplify is a different story though, especially in multiplayer. You don’t want to move on to the next side schemes until you can defeat them quickly. Take out Garm as fast as you can. After that, sit on the first side scheme and play your upgrades and supports. After you’ve built up, blow through the side schemes and finish off Hela.",
    "Loki": "Loki will always keep you on your toes. Each version of Loki has different strengths and his recommended mod sets are particularly scary. A high tempo and reliable hero is key to dealing with the many challenges he will throw your way. If you’re struggling too much with Loki, consider swapping out his mod sets for ones that are less control heavy. That can improve the experience if you find that you’re just getting locked down by Enchantress and the Frost Giants.",
    "The Hood": "It’s hard to rate The Hood because he is so dependent on what mod sets you use. Generally though, mod sets have a lot of side schemes and minions, so taking a hero/deck that can deal with side schemes and minions is important. I prefer a high tempo strategy that has the ability to deal with minions when you have to, but is focusing primarily on ending the game quickly before The Hood can pull off too many of his shenanigans. Adjust the mod sets to your liking!",
    "Sandman": "Sandman is a fairly straightforward villain, but things can go off the rails easily. If you let the sand counters get too high he starts dealing a lot of damage when the deck resets and the Sand Clones are a force to be reckoned with. You can easily counter him by just assigning a high ATK ally to sand counter duty. The Hulk ally from the core box is a great choice. Tell Hulk to clean up the city while you fight the Sandman!",
    "Venom": "Venom is a very interesting villain to fight. You never quite know what to expect. He can bring out a lot of side schemes, minions, or just pummel you with a barrage of blows. Stay on your toes and keep your wits about you, it’s going to be a wild ride. A key strategy against him is to use the bell tower. The best way to do it is to use chip damage to get it within one counter of flipping, then use your biggest attack event that you have available to flip the bell tower and maximize the number of counters you have available to damage Venom and protect you.",
    "Mysterio": "No matter how hard you try, it’s very difficult to outpace Mysterio by building your board. He will constantly throw encounter cards at you to slow you down. At some point, you just have to try and take him out. Take advantage of his low health pool to defeat him before he gets too many cards shuffled into your deck.",
    "Sinister Six": "The Sinister Six get stronger when they are allowed to team up on you. The best defense in this scenario is a good offense. Take out the villains as fast as you can. It weakens their encounter cards in addition to removing threat from Light At The End. As long as you don’t let the villains team up on you then you’ll be in good shape!",
    "Venom Goblin": "There is a lot to deal with in this scenario. You need a lot of thwarting, survivability, and minion control for this scenario. Similar to Mutagen Formula, you don’t want to hastily go to his final stage. The extra encounter cards he deals you can easily end the game. Do your best to stay afloat, build your board, and prepare to one shot his last stage so you don’t have to deal with all of those encounter cards. Watch out for the Advanced Glider. You need 3 cost worth of attack events to get rid of it. If your hero naturally has that then that helps a lot. If not, make sure to build it into your deck (or just use a different mod set). You get to choose what main scheme you want to deal with. At the beginning of the game, I like to choose the Lower Manhattan to keep as the lowest so that Venom Goblin’s ability will add threat. This allows you a little bit of breathing room to build your board state. In the midgame be intentional about where you want the glider counter to go. It will vary depending on the board state. Managing the glider counter, building your board, and storing damage for the final push are key to defeating this scenario.",
    "Sabertooth": "Sabertooth’s healing is tough to deal with. If you aren’t planning on trying to defeat an entire villain stage in the next couple of turns, then damaging him is pointless. Save your damage for when you can do it in bursts. Don’t feel like you have to rescue Robert Kelly immediately. You can use the first couple of turns to build your board before rescuing him. Once you have Robert Kelly, it is a big tax on the players. You have to invest your resources into keeping him alive. Choosing heroes that can easily defend for Robert Kelly and have burst damage available to them is key to defeating Sabertooth.",
    "Project Wideawake": "Project Wideawake punishes ally swarm strategies. Since chump blocking isn’t a viable strategy in this scenario, and the villain is steady on stage 2 and stalwart on stage 3, finding a way to survive can be difficult. Playing heroes that have good survivability in their hero kit makes this a lot easier. If your hero is squishy, you’ll have to resort to rushing or having high threat removal to allow you to safely access alter-ego to heal.",
    "Master Mold": "Master Mold brings in a lot of tough sentinel minions. Make sure to deck build such that you can easily defeat high health minions. The Magneto ally helps out a lot for this scenario. Try to keep him around so that you don’t become overwhelmed by minions.",
    "Mansion Attack": "Mansion Attack has global effects on the main schemes. Depending on your hero and deck that you’re using you’ll want to be intentional about which main scheme is out. If you’re running an ally strategy, you want to avoid the retaliate main scheme, and would prefer the +1 ATK main scheme. It’s okay to allow the main scheme to complete to get a more favorable global effect. There’s a common rules mistake to be aware of in this scenario. Main scheme 1 counts toward the loss condition even though it doesn’t feel like it should. If 2 different main scheme 2’s are completed, the players lose the game.",
    "Magneto": "The most effective strategy in my opinion to defeat magneto is to finish his side schemes as quickly as possible to remove steady and avoid the negative effects of Magneto’s main scheme completions. Then use stun and confuse status cards to stop Magneto from activating and adding Magnet counters. Watch out for the quadra boost card in the encounter deck. If the deck is getting thin and that card isn’t in the discard pile, it’s safest to assume he will get a +4 boost. Defeat Sentinel minions as soon as they appear. You don’t want to allow Magneto to hit you with Magnetic Missile. Remember that Magnet counters don’t carry over from one main scheme to the next. Also, there was an errata that instructs the player to remove the Magnet counters before discarding to get a Magnetic card.",
    "Magog": "The Magog scenario is a straight up brawl. It’s all about dishing out damage and avoiding taking damage. This scenario is particularly difficult on expert. As long as you are playing a high tempo game, and not relying on chump blocking to stay alive, you should be able to come out on top. Make use of alter-ego when you can to avoid letting him get counters. His scheme stat is much weaker than his attack stat. Status cards are your best friend against Magog.",
    "Spiral": "Spiral takes a lot of thought to defeat. There is a luck factor with the show deck that can lead to games that are more difficult than others. Make sure to do as much as you possibly can while she is cornered. You don’t want to miss the opportunity to do big damage. Having a lot of threat removal is very important for this scenario. The Crime modular makes this scenario particularly difficult. Don’t forget that if you need to you can take 2 damage to remove 3 threat from Search For Spiral.",
    "Mojo": "Mojo is an extremely difficult villain in my opinion. Don’t expect this to be an easy fight. Playing a high damage tempo strategy is best in my opinion. You’re on a timer, so if you don’t defeat him quickly you’ll lose the game to the encounter deck resetting. When the deck runs out and you get a new modular, there will be a lot of pressure added from the extra encounter cards. I find the Horror modular to be particularly difficult when playing Mojo.",
    "Morlock Siege": "Make sure that the first main scheme finishes with knock counters. It grants a tough to the Morlock allies which is very useful for keeping them alive. Playing heroes that are able to defend for the Morlocks and still deal damage to the villain is a good strategy. Expert Morlock Siege is often underestimated. The second villain will have retaliate 1 and the third villain will have retaliate 2. Playing a hero that can deal with retaliate well will make it easier on expert mode. Since you don’t know which villains you’ll fight, choosing a reliable hero is also a good idea.",
    "On The Run": "Reliable heroes and versatile deck builds are a good idea for this scenario since the villain is random. Be prepared to deal with a lot of minions in this scenario. Remember that the Teamwork trait was erratad such that only the minion that is entering play will activate.",
    "Juggernaut": "Taking the helmet off of Juggernaut is key to success. He loses overkill and stalwart in addition to your cards with mental resources doing increased damage. Hope Summers has a printed mental resource so she also gets that boost. Don’t underestimate Juggernaut. He can put his helmet back on and squash you in a moment's notice. Keep your health high so that you can handle an extra activation.",
    "Mister Sinister": "Mister Sinister is a high pressure scenario. If you can, try to keep the main schemes from finishing to avoid him getting more super powers. Reliable heroes are a good choice because you don’t know which super power he will get. Don’t rely too much on chump blocking your deck building because Flight grants him overkill.",
    "Stryfe": "Stryfe adds pressure early with the crisis icon. You’re in a race to finish Stryfe’s Grasp before he finishes the main scheme. Make sure that you’re playing a high tempo hero with good thwarting and or build that into your deck. The second main scheme gives you increased hand size but increases the cost of each card you play. It’s in your best interest to play expensive cards instead of cheap cards so that you lose less resources over the course of the game. On stage 3 try to have the damage card you play be the last card in your hand to minimize the amount of damage you take from Stryfe’s ability.",
    "Unus": "Unus is all about Gene Pool. It punishes chump blocking by making him stronger. If the threat on Gene Pool gets high, Unus gains retaliate, amplify, and stalwart, which are all very difficult to deal with, and the Infinites gain guard, increased hp, and surge. Brutal! Do your best to keep Gene Pool low and not chump block with allies. If Gene Pool starts getting too high and you feel like you can’t control it, try to end the game. This scenario is surprisingly difficult, especially for being the first villain of a box. Don’t underestimate Unus.",
    "Four Horsemen": "The Four Horsemen are a unique challenge. Each villain has a unique detrimental effect. You can shut that effect off by reducing their hp to 0. Choose wisely which one you want to get rid of first. If you are playing a deck with important upgrades/supports I recommend taking out War first. Depending on the situation the correct choice will vary. Stunning/confusing them is also a good strategy because it avoids their effects. Prepare for an intense battle! The Horsemen of the apocalypse are relentless.",
    "Apocalypse 1": "This scenario is essentially an evolution of Hela. But unlike Hela, it isn’t as gameable. There is no one optimal way to defeat this scenario. You need to have a hero that is versatile and can deal a lot of damage, stay alive, and remove a lot of threat. Don’t forget that if you need to thwart the main scheme, you can do that by defeating Apocalypse. It also gets rid of his attachments and can even ignore the crisis icon. Knowing when it’s the correct time to complete the side schemes is key to victory, but there isn’t one correct answer. You have to assess the situation and adapt to the current game state.",
    "Dark Beast": "Dark Beast is no pushover, but it will feel relaxing compared to the first 3 scenarios of this box. He plays differently depending on the environment. He doesn’t do anything that scary, but he can throw you for a loop! Be careful about when you defeat his first stage. He can have big turns after revealing a new environment and dealing you an encounter card. This scenario feels more like classic Marvel Champions.",
    "Apocalypse 2": "Apocalypse 2 is the first 3 sided form changing villain. Each side has its own challenges. Biomorph grants overkill and deals damage to the players after changing to that form. Cyberpath grants retaliate and adds threat to each scheme after changing to that form. And Giant grants Stalwart and heals Apocalypse after he changes to that form. Depending on the hero/deck you’re playing, certain forms will be easier to deal with than others. Try not to leave side schemes on the board because after Apocalypse changes to Cyberpath, it adds threat to each one. The difficulty of this scenario varies wildly across player count. In solo, it’s not that difficult, but in 4 player, it’s one of the hardest scenarios in the game, so be prepared!",
    "Black Widow": "Black Widow is a difficult villain. Don’t let her being the first villain of the box fool you. She adds a lot of threat to the main scheme when you advance to the next villain stage. There is a constant balance between attacking with many small attacks to remove threat, and hitting for a lot of damage at once and removing less threat. With many instances of damage you run the risk of triggering more preparations, but if you hit with one big burst, you run the risk of her redirecting all of that damage with Attacrobatics while playing on expert mode. I suggest tracking both copies of Attacrobatics so you don’t get blindsided. Don’t push her to the next stage unless you’re ready to finish the game.",
    "Batroc": "The alert level is an extra source of difficulty in this scenario. If you let the alarm go to high alert, Batroc gets a stat boost. You can spend resources to reduce the amount of counters on the alarm. After you rescue a captive you get to choose whether you want to advance to the next stage or stick around to rescue more. If you feel that your hero can protect the captives easily, or that you can take out Batroc quickly, you may want to advance after the first captive. If you want to play it safe, you can rescue more captives. The last stage of the main scheme causes the enemies to attack the captives and each minion gains quick strike. If you aren’t prepared this can blind side you. Make sure that you’re ready to deal with that before advancing.",
    "M.O.D.O.K.": "M.O.D.O.K. has retaliate 2 on expert mode which makes it difficult to safely deal damage to him. Also, if you don’t defeat him, he continues to get more upgrades that can add pressure to the scenario. When you get the chance to deal a lot of damage with one attack, take the opportunity. Also be on the lookout for ways to deal damage that aren’t technically an attack. The Iliad from Maria Hill’s kit is a good example of that. This scenario is about balancing when it is a good idea to defeat M.O.D.O.K. and when it is a good idea to spend resources to remove lock counters.",
    "Thunderbolts": "Citizen V is a new take on multi-villain scenarios. The Thunderbolt minions are essentially the villain. You’ll want to focus on them first because if you damage Citizen V he will just heal. Focus on first defeating the Thunderbolt minions, then Citizen V.",
    "Baron Zemo": "To me, Baron Zemo is primarily a campaign villain. You can play him in stand alone, but the experience will feel much different. This scenario requires that you spend resources to manage the counters on the board members. Playing high economy heroes can help with this. If you have control of the board you can gather enough evidence to guarantee that you correctly guess who the mole is. If things are getting out of control, it may be worth taking a guess on who the mole is before you’re sure.",

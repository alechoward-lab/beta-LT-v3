villain_strategies = {
    "Rhino": "Look out for his charge attacks. In solo, be careful about going to Alter-Ego. Always keep track of how many Advances are in the discard pile.",
    
    "Klaw": "Klaw adds a lot of pressure early. Minion control, tempo, and threat removal are key to defeating him.",
    
    "Ultron": "Ultron floods the board with drones. Make sure you can take them out. If your hero is bad at defeating multiple minions, add Hawkeye to your deck. If your hero deals with minions easily, still consider adding Hawkeye. Try to keep him on stage 1 of his main scheme. Building up your board while controlling minions is key to winning.",
    
    "Risky Business": "This is a bizarre scenario. Don't flip Norman unless you can deal a big chunk of damage. Building your upgrades and supports while he is Norman Osborn is key to winning.",
    
    "Mutagen Formula": "There will be a lot of pressure early due to the encounter cards. His deck isn't that scary, but he can flood the board with mid-health minions. Stay in control of the minions, build your board, and try to one-shot him on stage 3 to avoid extra encounter cards.",
    
    "Wrecking Crew": "Prioritize taking out one villain at a time. Make heavy use of Alter-Ego since there is little pressure from threat.",
    
    "Crossbones": "Crossbones has a lot of damage, but a generous main scheme. Playing heroes with good survivability will help. His scariest card is Full Auto. Keep track of both copies and maintain high health to avoid random losses.",
    
    "Absorbing Man": "Absorbing Man unfortunately just doesn't do much. The Super Absorbing Power side scheme can boost him, so prioritize finishing it when it's out. A good opportunity to try lower-tier heroes.",
    
    "Taskmaster": "Taskmaster does a bit of everything, but nothing is particularly scary. Rescuing the allies Captured by Hydra helps a lot—they're very powerful!",
    
    "Zola": "Zola brings in a lot of tough minions, and his Retaliate 1 is tough to deal with. He doesn't have high health though, so take every chance to do big chunks of damage. Overkill ignores Retaliate. Relentless Assault is great here. Do not underestimate Zola—the game can collapse quickly!",
    
    "Red Skull": "Red Skull's constant side schemes and boosted attack are a lot to handle. Don’t let the side schemes pile up. Bring a Justice player to manage them. Be ready to deal with The Sleeper when it appears.",
    
    "Kang": "Kang throws many different challenges at the players. Especially in stage 2 when players are split, having a reliable, self-sufficient hero is key to surviving.",
    
    "Drang": "Drang adds a lot of threat. In solo, using the Milano to remove 3 threat is strong. In multiplayer, someone should bring a solid Justice deck. Be ready to handle side schemes every turn.",
    
    "Collector 1": "The Collection fills up quickly—he even collects his own cards! Use high-tempo decks. Avoid building a wide board, as allies sent to the collection make survivability tough. Event-heavy decks shine here.",
    
    "Collector 2": "This scenario revolves around threat control. You can thwart the main scheme or reduce Collector's HP. Don't complete the scheme unless you can thwart afterward—losing to a single Advance is possible.",
    
    "Nebula": "Very swingy scenario. Surge trains are common, especially at 2–4 players. In solo, outcomes can vary widely. Keep evasion counters on the main scheme low, and defeat her fast before encounter card chaos defeats you.",
    
    "Ronan": "Ronan is the toughest boss in the game. He starts with Stalwart and high base ATK and often hits for 8–10 damage. Flipping to Alter-Ego often loses you the scheme. Fanaticism is brutal—surges, gives Overkill and Piercing. Avoid or cancel it when possible. Sunfire can remove the Universal Weapon. Bring broken combos—you’ll need them.",
    
    "Ebony Maw": "Maw’s spells have delayed effects. Plan around damage windows and upcoming threats.",
    
    "Tower Defense": "Two villains and two towers. Coordinate threat removal and divide responsibilities effectively.",
    
    "Thanos": "Thanos ignores Stun and Confuse. Bring raw damage, sustain, and consistent status-free tools.",
    
    "Hela": "Hela revives powerful minions as her scheme progresses. Targeted removal and tempo control are essential.",
    
    "Loki": "Loki swaps forms during the fight, each with different effects. Versatile decks and adaptation are key.",
    
    "The Hood": "The Hood chains modular sets together. Be ready for unpredictable effects. Build flexible, resilient decks.",
    
    "Sandman": "Sandman ramps threat and discards cards. Maintain steady pacing and strong thwart options.",
    
    "Venom": "Venom brings fast tempo and burst damage. Prioritize efficient damage and healing mitigation.",
    
    "Mysterio": "Mysterio clogs your deck with encounter cards. Deck filtering and resource smoothing help a lot.",
    
    "Sinister Six": "Multiple rotating villains. Focus damage efficiently and manage the board with crowd control.",
    
    "Venom Goblin": "Spreads threat across multiple schemes. Use AOE and efficient thwarting to keep control.",
    
    "Sabretooth": "Sabretooth heals frequently. Burst damage and preventing healing are key strategies.",
    
    "Project Wideawake": "Sentinels and capture mechanics dominate. Freeing captured allies should be top priority.",
    
    "Master Mold": "Master Mold produces Sentinel minions fast. Strong minion control is essential.",
    
    "Mansion Attack": "Team-focused scenario with split threat zones. Coordination and AOE help significantly.",
    
    "Magneto": "Magneto gains power through upgrades. You’ll need to balance aggression with good threat control.",
    
    "Magog": "Magog gains points in the arena. Deny his score and pivot to burst damage windows.",
    
    "Spiral": "Spiral hides in side schemes. Heavy thwart decks can find and take her out more easily.",
    
    "Mojo": "Mojo’s changing shows create unpredictable effects. Stay versatile and adapt quickly.",
    
    "Morlock Siege": "Rescue allies and manage swarms of minions. Balanced stats and control are key.",
    
    "On The Run": "The villain shifts across different zones. Mobility and fast thwarting will help a lot.",
    
    "Juggernaut": "Juggernaut deals heavy damage consistently. Defense, healing, and mitigation are vital.",
    
    "Mister Sinister": "Sinister mutates minions and boosts stats. Prioritize control and clean removal.",
    
    "Stryfe": "Stryfe mixes heavy threat and raw power. Decks with flexibility and responsiveness work well.",
    
    "Unus": "Unus uses barriers and resistance. Piercing effects and high-damage events perform best.",
    
    "Four Horsemen": "Face multiple strong villains. Balancing burst damage and control will carry you.",
    
    "Apocalypse 1": "This is just the beginning. Focus on building carefully and conserving key resources.",
    
    "Dark Beast": "Dark Beast specializes in sabotage. Denial and event-based disruption shine here.",
    
    "Apocalypse 2": "Endgame boss mode. Bring your most consistent and powerful builds to survive.",

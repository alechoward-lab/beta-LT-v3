 villain_strategies = {
    "Rhino": "Look out for his charge attacks. In solo be careful about going to alter-ego. Always keep track of how many advances are in the discard pile.",
    "Klaw": "Klaw adds a lot of pressure early. Minion control, tempo, and threat removal are key to defeating him.",
    "Ultron": "Ultron floods the board with drones. Make sure you can take them out. If your hero is bad at defeating multiple minions, add Hawkeye to your deck. If your hero deals with minions easily, still consider adding Hawkeye. Try to keep him on stage 1 of his main scheme. Building up your board while controlling minions is key to winning.",
    "Risky Business": "This is a bizarre scenario. Don't flip Norman unless you can deal a big chunk of damage. Building your upgrades and supports while he is Norman Osborn is key to winning.",
    "Mutagen Formula": "There will be a lot of pressure early due to the encounter cards. His encounter deck isn't that scary, but he can flood the board with mid-health minions. Stay in control of the minions, build your board, and try to one-shot him on stage 3 if you can to avoid dealing with all the encounter cards.",
    "Wrecking Crew": "Prioritize taking out one villain at a time. Make heavy use of alter-ego since there is little pressure due to threat.",
    "Crossbones": "Crossbones has a lot of damage, but a generous main scheme. Playing heroes with good survivability will be helpful. His scariest card is Full Auto. Keep track of both copies, and make sure to keep your health high to avoid random losses.",
    "Absorbing Man": "Absorbing Man unfortunately just doesn't do much. The Super Absorbing Power side scheme can give him a boost in power, so prioritize finishing that scheme when it's out. Absorbing Man is a good opportunity to try some of the heroes that are lower on the tier list.",
    "Taskmaster": "Taskmaster does a bit of everything, but nothing is that scary. Don't expect an easy game though! Rescuing the allies that have been Captured By Hydra will help a lot because they're very powerful!",
    "Zola": "Zola brings in a lot of tough minions and having Retaliate 1 is difficult to deal with. He doesn't have high health though. Take every opportunity you get to do big chunks of damage to him. Overkill ignores retaliate damage. Relentless Assault is a great card to add because it solves two problems at once (Minions and Retaliate). Do not underestimate Zola. The game can go bad in an instant!",
    "Red Skull": "Red Skull's ability to bring a side scheme into play every turn and increase his attack is very powerful. It's a lot to deal with. You can't let them pile up. Make sure to bring a Justice player to the table to help keep those schemes in line. Be prepared to deal with The Sleeper. You need to have a source of damage at the ready when The Sleeper comes into play.",
    "Kang": "Kang will throw many different challenges at the players. Particularly on stage 2 when he splits everyone up, you don't know what challenges you will face. Having a reliable hero that is self-sufficient is key to surviving the second stage.",
    "Drang": "Drang adds a lot of threat to the board. The main scheme goes up by 2 per player each turn, and there are a lot of side schemes. In solo the action to exhaust the Milano to remove 3 threat from the schemes is powerful and will help a lot, but at 2–4 players you need more removal. In multiplayer I suggest at least one hero brings a powerful Justice deck.",
    "Collector 1": "The Collection fills up very quickly, especially when you realize that the Collector collects his own cards! I recommend a high-tempo strategy against him. You don't want to stick around building your board against him because it will give him more chances to steal your cards. Allies aren't as good against him because they go into the collection if they block for you. This makes survivability more difficult to solve. Use event-heavy decks because events don't go into the collection and defeat him as quick as possible.",
    "Collector 2": "This scenario is all about removing threat from the main scheme. You can do that either by reducing the Collector's HP to 0 or by thwarting normally. As long as you have a decent deck and make thoughtful decisions, you should be able to win. Be careful about completing the main scheme too quickly. The starting threat is high enough that you can lose to 1 advance. Make sure that you can thwart a little bit after completing each main scheme to help protect against bad luck in the encounter deck.",
    "Nebula": "This scenario is very swingy. Nebula is prone to surge trains. In solo, some games will be easy, and some will be difficult. In 2–4 player count expect to see multiple surge trains. The evasion counters on the main scheme can get out of control quickly. Keep those low at all costs and try to defeat her as soon as possible. The longer you stick around in this scenario the more likely it is that you'll run into a crazy string of encounter cards that will defeat you.",
    "Ronan": "Ronan is the premier final boss of the game. He starts stalwart with high base ATK and will frequently hit for 8–10 damage. To make matters worse, his main scheme goes up by 2 per player each round and has a low threshold. In solo, flipping to alter-ego essentially guarantees you'll lose the main scheme. To make matters worse, Fanaticism is possibly the worst encounter card in the whole game. It gives his next attacks piercing and overkill, and for some reason it also surges. Avoiding this card through either luck or encounter deck manipulation is key to winning. Sunfire is a great ally to take because you can get rid of the Universal weapon without needing to shuffle it into the encounter deck and dealing yourself an encounter card. Fight broken with broken. Go all out to find as many gamebreaking combos as you can when you face Ronan. You'll need them.",
    "Ebony Maw": "Ebony Maw removes a counter from the spell environments “When” he activates against you. That means if the last counter is removed, it actually goes off before the activation finishes. That can be rough because sometimes your allies may be defeated before they can block. The easiest way to defeat him is by status locking him to avoid removing counters from the spell environments. Sometimes Ebony Maw will do a crazy surge train and take you out in one turn, so be on guard for that. Most of the time he will be a decent challenge, but a manageable one.",
    "Tower Defense": "This scenario is generally low on pressure because the tower can take so much damage before the players lose. Use the main schemes to your advantage. If you have a lot of health on the tower remaining, it’s okay to let Proxima’s main scheme finish if you are low on threat removal. If you need to protect the tower, it’s okay to let Corvus’s main scheme finish; getting one encounter card isn’t that bad. Sometimes the villains can team up for a big attack, so it’s best to try and always have at least 1 ally available to block as a backup. Be thoughtful, and you should be able to win.",
    "Thanos": "Thanos is a difficult villain, but also an easy villain. It seems like you’re under a lot of pressure at the beginning, but you aren’t actually. Don’t worry about attacking him. The best strategy is to thwart the main scheme and defeat minions while you build up your board. Don’t worry about damaging Thanos until the second deck-pass after you’ve completed your setup and have things under control. Most of the difficulty comes from the gauntlet. As a result, his encounter cards on their own are actually very weak. The only scary card he has is Avatar of Death. Keep track of both copies of that card. When they are in the discard pile, the scariest cards he has are the standard set. Build your board, play around the stones, and win after a long battle.",
    "Hela": "Similar to Thanos, you want to play it slow against Hela. She doesn’t add much pressure at the beginning of the game, especially in multiplayer. That’s because having one acceleration icon on a thick main scheme doesn’t do much. Amplify is a different story though, especially in multiplayer. You don’t want to move on to the next side schemes until you can defeat them quickly. Take out Garm as fast as you can. After that, sit on the first side scheme and play your upgrades and supports. After you’ve built up, blow through the side schemes and finish off Hela.",
    "Loki": "Loki will always keep you on your toes. Each version of Loki has different strengths and his recommended mod sets are particularly scary. A high tempo and reliable hero is key to dealing with the many challenges he will throw your way. If you’re struggling too much with Loki, consider swapping out his mod sets for ones that are less control heavy. That can improve the experience if you find that you’re just getting locked down by Enchantress and the Frost Giants.",
    "The Hood": "It’s hard to rate The Hood because he is so dependent on what mod sets you use. Generally though, mod sets have a lot of side schemes and minions, so taking a hero/deck that can deal with side schemes and minions is important. I prefer a high tempo strategy that has the ability to deal with minions when you have to, but is focusing primarily on ending the game quickly before The Hood can pull off too many of his shenanigans. Adjust the mod sets to your liking!",
    "Sandman": "Sandman is a fairly straightforward villain, but things can go off the rails easily. If you let the sand counters get too high he starts dealing a lot of damage when the deck resets and the Sand Clones are a force to be reckoned with. You can easily counter him by just assigning a high ATK ally to sand counter duty. The Hulk ally from the core box is a great choice. Tell Hulk to clean up the city while you fight the Sandman!",
    "Venom": "Venom is a very interesting villain to fight. You never quite know what to expect. He can bring out a lot of side schemes, minions, or just pummel you with a barrage of blows. Stay on your toes and keep your wits about you, it’s going to be a wild ride. A key strategy against him is to use the bell tower. The best way to do it is to use chip damage to get it within one counter of flipping, then use your biggest attack event that you have available to flip the bell tower and maximize the number of counters you have available to damage Venom and protect you.",
    "Mysterio": "No matter how hard you try, it’s very difficult to outpace Mysterio by building your board. He will constantly throw encounter cards at you to slow you down. At some point, you just have to try and take him out. Take advantage of his low health pool to defeat him before he gets too many cards shuffled into your deck.",
    "Sinister Six": "The Sinister Six get stronger when they are allowed to team up on you. The best defense in this scenario is a good offense. Take out the villains as fast as you can. It weakens their encounter cards in addition to removing threat from Light At The End. As long as you don’t let the villains team up on you then you’ll be in good shape!",
    "Venom Goblin": "There is a lot to deal with in this scenario. You need a lot of thwarting, survivability, and minion control for this scenario. Similar to Mutagen Formula, you don’t want to hastily go to his final stage. The extra encounter cards he deals you can easily end the game. Do your best to stay afloat, build your board, and prepare to one shot his last stage so you don’t have to deal with all of those encounter cards. Watch out for the Advanced Glider. You need 3 cost worth of attack events to get rid of it. If your hero naturally has that then that helps a lot. If not, make sure to build it into your deck (or just use a different mod set). You get to choose what main scheme you want to deal with. At the beginning of the game, I like to choose the Lower Manhattan to keep as the lowest so that Venom Goblin’s ability will add threat. This allows you a little bit of breathing room to build your board state. In the midgame be intentional about where you want the glider counter to go. It will vary depending on the board state. Managing the glider counter, building your board, and storing damage for the final push are key to defeating this scenario.",
    "Sabertooth": "Sabertooth heals often. Burst damage and healing denial help you keep up.",
    "Project Wideawake": "Lots of Sentinels and capture mechanics. Prioritize freeing allies.",
    "Master Mold": "Master Mold produces sentinels quickly. Minion control is essential.",
    "Mansion Attack": "Team-based scenario with split threats. Coordination and area control work well.",
    "Magneto": "Magneto builds momentum with upgrades. Aggression and thwart balance are crucial.",
    "Magog": "Magog builds a stadium score. Deny points and pivot to burst damage.",
    "Spiral": "Spiral hides in side schemes. Thwart-heavy decks can find and defeat her quickly.",
    "Mojo": "Mojo’s changing shows alter the fight. Stay versatile and ready for surprises.",
    "Morlock Siege": "Rescue allies and control minions. Balanced stat lines shine here.",
    "On The Run": "A mobile villain that shifts zones. Mobility and quick scheme clears are helpful.",
    "Juggernaut": "Juggernaut hits hard and often. Defense and healing are crucial.",
    "Mister Sinister": "Sinister mutates minions and stats. Removal and control are valuable.",
    "Stryfe": "Stryfe mixes threat and force. Versatile decks and reactiveness are helpful.",
    "Unus": "Unus uses barriers and resistance. High-damage and piercing cards work best.",
    "Four Horsemen": "Multiple strong villains—balance is key. Adapt between damage and control.",
    "Apocalypse 1": "Stage one of a long battle. Build up carefully and conserve resources.",
    "Dark Beast": "Dark Beast uses science and sabotage. Denial and disruption shine here.",
    "Apocalypse 2": "Endgame boss mode. Bring your strongest builds and consistent answers.",
